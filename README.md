## ðŸ“Œ Adaptive Error Detection in Time Series Forecasting
**Goal:**  
Develop a method to detect and adapt to **data drift** and **error deviations** in **Time Series Forecasting** to improve prediction performance.  

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Implemented **RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Linear Regression** models on NVIDIA stock price data.
- Applied **Adaptive Cross-Validation** to dynamically retrain models with updated data.
- Introduced **Concept Drift Detection** techniques for real-time model adjustment.
- Enhanced performance using **Feature Engineering**:
  - `Return`, `Volatility`, `Price_Diff`, `Volume_Log`
- Utilized statistical tests (**KS Test, Mann-Whitney U, Cohenâ€™s d**) to validate drift detection effectiveness.

### ðŸ“Š Results:
- Improved RMSE and overall forecasting accuracy with adaptive model retraining.
- Successfully handled data drift scenarios for robust time series forecasting.
